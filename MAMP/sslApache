First generate certifcate 

mkdir /Appclition/MAMP/conf/apache/ssl

cd /Appclition/MAMP/conf/apache/ssl

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mysitename.key -out mysitename.crt


now config Apache


cd /Appclition/MAMP/conf/apache/

nano httpd.conf


Configuring httpd.conf

First open the httpd.conf file and uncomment the following lines:

LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

Next set the Servername to localhost:443 (make sure there is only one Servername defined in the file)

Servername  localhost:443


Configuring httpd-ssl.conf

Then in the httpd-ssl.conf file do the following:

Set Listen to 443

Listen 443

Note: From MAMP 4.4.1 onwards, adding this might not be necessary. If Apache fails to start with the ‘could not bind to address [::]:443′ error, you might have to comment out the ‘Listen 443’ line by placing # in front of it.

Next find the virtualhost configuration which looks something like this:

<VirtualHost _default_:443>

# General setup for the virtual host
DocumentRoot “/Applications/MAMP/Library/htdocs”
ServerName localhost:443
ServerAdmin you@example.com
ErrorLog “/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/error_log”
TransferLog “/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/access_log”

# SSL Engine Switch:
# Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
SSLEngine off

A couple of things need to be changed in this configuration. First, the VirtualHost should be set to *:443, instead of _default_:443. Make sure the DocumentRoot is correct. The ServerName should be changed to localhost:443. Finally, the SSLEngine needs to be set to on. The result should look like this:

<VirtualHost *:443>

# General setup for the virtual host
DocumentRoot “/Applications/MAMP/htdocs”
ServerName localhost
ServerAdmin you@example.com
ErrorLog “/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/error_log”
TransferLog “/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/access_log”

# SSL Engine Switch:
# Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
SSLEngine on

Finally specify the SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile directives. Add the location of the .crt file you have generated earlier after SSLCertificateFile.

Add the location of the .key file to the SSLCertificateKeyFile directive.

In my case, it looks like this:

SSLCertificateFile “/Appclition/MAMP/conf/apache/ssl/mysitename.crt”

SSLCertificateKeyFile “/Appclition/MAMP/conf/apache/ssl/mysitename.key”
